**Project Description:**

**2048 Game** is an interactive web-based game implemented using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. Inspired by the popular single-player sliding block puzzle game, this web version of 2048 provides users with an engaging and challenging gameplay experience. Players are tasked with sliding numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

The implementation of HTML provides the structural foundation for the game interface, while Sass is utilized to streamline the styling process, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive user interface. JavaScript is the key programming language behind the game's functionality, enabling smooth gameplay mechanics, interactive elements, and scoring logic.
